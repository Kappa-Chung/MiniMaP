# Title
On-site Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Paper Spray Ionization Miniature Mass Spectrometry

# Abstract
Conventional histopathological examination for breast core needle biopsy diagnosis is time- and labor-intensive. Here, we developed a miniature mass spectrometry coupled with paper spray ionization (MiniMaP) platform for rapid and accurate breast cancer diagnosis. The adoption of paper spray ionization enables analysis without sample preparation while the miniature mass spectrometer provides cost- and size-effective solution for transferring the platform into clinics. A machine learning model was built from the molecular profile of breast core needle biopsies acquired using MiniMaP, achieving 88% accuracy for breast cancer diagnosis. A consistent accuracy (84%) was achieved in the 22-month multicenter validation. We believe that the MiniMaP platform is feasible for routine breast cancer diagnosis in clinics, providing instant diagnostic reports to patients and physicians for better medical care.
